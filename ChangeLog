==== version 2.1.1 (2021-04-23) ====

* imx6 coda: fix bug in IPU based detiling related to frame width/height
* imx6 coda: use the frame width/height from open params if available
* imx6 coda: fix duplicate VPU firmware unloading
* imx8 hantro encoder: fix mid-stream bitrate changes and bitrate logging

==== version 2.1.0 (2020-10-18) ====

* introduce RGB and packed YUV formats since the Hantro encoder
  supports those
* remove hardware specific public headers since they only added
  tiled pixel formats; instead, migrate these tiled formats into
  ImxVpuApiColorFormat
* imx8 hantro decoder: reorder list of supported decoder color
  formats to favor 10 bit output
* imx8 hantro decoder: clear new framebuffer fields to zero
* imx8 hantro encoder: fix segfault caused by trying to unmap
  non existing staged raw frame

==== version 2.0.1 (2020-04-19) ====

* imx6: replace mxcfb.h check with i.MX6 specific imx header check
  the mcxfb.h check only makes sense with i.MX6 devices, so requiring
  those for others like i.MX8 led to build errors
* update waf to 2.0.12 and switch wscript to use Python 3
* imx6: fix encoder pointer usage in vpu_EncGiveCommand() call

==== version 2.0.0 (2019-07-21) ====

* complete rewrite to support i.MX6, i.MX8m, i.MX8mm VPUs

==== version 0.10.3 (2016-10-12) ====

* properly pass on color format in simplified JPEG encoder interface
* add alternative write-callback-style encoding mode
  also add encode example variant which uses write-callback style output
* add support for "fake grayscale mode" in encoders
  this is done by using I420 internally and filling the U and V planes
  with 0x80 bytes
* make sure JPEG quantization table is copied in standardized zig zag order
  the VPU does not, so this has to be done explicitely

==== version 0.10.2 (2016-05-01) ====

* fix AUD NAL positioning in h.264 encoder output
  (SPS/PPS/AUD were ordered incorrectly - AUD has to come first, not last)
* fix build error with examples when --enable-static is used
* pass quality factor in simplified JPEG encoder interface correctly
* add functions for querying and setting header data
  useful for modifying headers, like VUI data in the SPS RBSP
* documentation updates

==== version 0.10.1 (2015-11-30) ====

* add debian packaging files
* update waf to version 1.8.16
* add workaround in wscript to prevent stale pkg-config .pc files
* fix memory leak by adding missing IOFreeVirtMem() call in vpulib backend

==== version 0.10.0 (2015-11-02) ====
